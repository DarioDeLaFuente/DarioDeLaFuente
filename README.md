### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dario De La Fuente, a 40 year old Norwegian front-end developer student.

I have worked as Tech support in a company called Visma Digital Commerce for over 1 year. Tech support had several different roles in that company,Front-end developing was a small part of it.

I think this is a very exciting profession, which is why I am a student on the way to becoming a front-end developer.
